Use the string format vulnarability of printing
values that are already in the stack.

We use '%X' to print values from the stack and this
can be any value on the stack so using a bunch of 
these characters can print the flag
because the flag was already stored onto the stack

when we read the file. YOu can check out the vuln.c
file to find more information on this.

After inputing the character to print from the 
stack we can take the hexadecimal value displayed
then convert it to ascii.

You'll find the flag somewhere on the output the
flag is split into 4 characters and reversed too
so you'll do this manually or use a program

I wrote a java code:

			Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
	        System.out.println("Input vale:");
	        String text = scan.nextLine();
	        
	        List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
	        int index = 0;
	        while (index < text.length()) {
	            strings.add(text.substring(index, Math.min(index + 4,text.length())));
	            index += 4;
	        }
	        
	        List<String> rev_strings = new ArrayList<>();
	        
	        // reverse the array
	        strings.stream().map((str) -> new StringBuilder(str)).forEachOrdered((sb) -> {
	            rev_strings.add(sb.reverse().toString());
	        });
	        
	        rev_strings.forEach((x) -> {
	            System.out.print(x);
	        });

	 This code simplifies everything for you cause you don't have
	 to reverse characters yourself you just give the input then 
	 the job will be done for you.
